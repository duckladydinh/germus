A Personal German Layout on US Keyboard Installer for Ubuntu.

I prefer the US layout, but as a German learner, typing German is inevitable and hence it would be a pain if I cannot type the umlaut character such as ä, ö, ü, Ä, Ö, Ü, and the ß (Right Alt + a, o, u, A, O, U, s). Hence I created this layout for my personal use. 

To install it simply run 

```bash
>> sudo bash install.bash 
```

and then search for English (US, Thuan) layout in Region & Language.

Please note that some non-standard layouts may have been removed since I haven't updated this for a long time. It does not concern me since I am only using the standard US layout and some special German characters. Anyway, this script is for my personal use only.

Browsers like Firefox and Chrome maybe closed since I also restarted the Gnome Shell.
